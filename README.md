# HR ADMIN PROGRAM

#About the software

This software allows the employer to administer its employees,
and the employer can sign up as a company and register its employees by department. 
Moreover, this program enables the employer to register its employees 
in a database base on age, hired date, department, payroll, and personal information such as SSN, address, etc.

#Built With:
Technologies I have been using: Django, bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. 

#Disclaimer
This program is far from perfect, but still working on it, still applying changes.
